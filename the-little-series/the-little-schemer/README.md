# the_litter_schemer
We use a few notational conventions throughout the text , primarily changes in typeface
for different classes of symbols. Variables and the names of primitive operations are in italic.
Basic data, including numbers and representations of truth and falsehood, is set in sans serif.
Keywords, i.e. , define, lambda, cond, else, and, or, and quote, are in boldface. When you
try the programs, you may ignore the typefaces but not the related framenotes. To highlight
this role of typefaces, the programs in framenotes are set in a typewriter face. The typeface
distinctions can be safely ignored until chapter 10, where we treat programs as data.
